On the one hand, we are _not_ trying to estimate model performance on a previously unseen data sample, so theoretically including Big Mountain data should be fine. One might first think that including Big Mountain in the model training would, if anything, improve model performance in predicting Big Mountain's ticket price. But here's where our business context comes in. The motivation for this entire project is based on the sense that Big Mountain needs to adjust its pricing. One way to phrase this problem: we want to train a model to predict Big Mountain's ticket price based on data from _all the other_ resorts! We don't want Big Mountain's current price to bias this. We want to calculate a price based only on its competitors."

What does your modelling suggest for a ticket price that could be supported in the marketplace by Big Mountain's facilities? How would you approach suggesting such a change to the business leadership? Discuss the additional operating cost of the new chair lift per ticket (on the basis of each visitor on average buying 5 day tickets) in the context of raising prices to cover this. For future improvements, state which, if any, of the modeled scenarios you'd recommend for further consideration. Suggest how the business might test, and progress, with any run closures."

    "To propose this change to leadership, the recommendation would be framed around covering the $1.54M added cost of the new chair lift, distributed across expected visitors. Assuming each visitor purchases an average of five day tickets, this translates to an additional $9–10 per ticket required to break even on the new lift. This adjustment aligns with the model’s prediction of the market supported price.\n",

    "The scenarios tested showed that incremental price adjustments (rather than a steep immediate increase) would allow the resort to monitor visitor reactions and avoid churn. Among the modeled scenarios, the gradual price increase scenario (raising prices over two seasons) is recommended for further consideration. For future progression, the resort could pilot price increases during peak weekends or test limited run closures to observe price elasticity before rolling out full changes."

Big Mountain was already fairly high on some of the league charts of facilities offered, but why was its modeled price so much higher than its current price? Would this mismatch come as a surprise to the business executives? How would you find out? Assuming the business leaders felt this model was useful, how would the business make use of it?

    "Although Big Mountain already ranks high in facility offerings, the modeled ticket price was significantly higher than its current price. This mismatch suggests either undervalued pricing in the market or potential gaps in the dataset (e.g., competitor promotions, discounting strategies). Business executives may find this surprising, so it would be critical to validate results through surveys, competitor benchmarking, and A/B testing actual price changes.\n",

    "If leadership accepts the model’s usefulness, the next step would be to make it accessible via a business intelligence tool (e.g., Tableau, or Power BI) so that analysts can run their own pricing scenarios. This prevents over-reliance on the data science team for every new analysis and empowers managers to test combinations of parameters (e.g., weather, seasonal demand, partial closures)."
